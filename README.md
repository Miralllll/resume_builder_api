&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My project is the resume builder, which offers this service by filling out diverse forms 
or modifying the latex of the resume template. The main idea is that it has to help users to 
build a resume with flexible questionaries represented as forms. To be more specific, users will 
have the power to decide, for instance, in the work experience section, how many experiences 
they want to put in. Additionally, after filling out the information about the specific jobs, if a 
user changes their mind and wants to delete a section element from all the jobs, they can do it 
anytime by clicking the minus button. Additionally, based on any filled-out information or 
the latex, a user can display the generated pdf on the right side of the website by clicking the 
run button.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking for a job is a very tiring and nonstop process nowadays. Choosing the 
right employers also demands plenty of exertion. Overall, we see that the possibility of 
connecting back to the candidates and scheduling interviews is becoming more and more 
dependent on the quality of their resumes. Therefore, the trend and their desire to find a 
platform to help them are tremendous. Even so, many websites on this market are trying to 
offer solutions to this problem in various ways there are only a few oriented toward the 
freedom of users' choice. That is where I saw potential. Individualism is a big trend. However, 
users do not know where they can find it or what they can help. The evidence is tons of 
questions and posts on social media related to this topic. People are expressing their confusion 
and asking for help in the resume-building process. They want to find a platform to be helped. 
Finally, we see that actuality of something similar is undeniably huge because of the 
market size. And in this market, my target group is people who want a more flexible tool to 
build a resume. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With this web application, I want to help those free spirits and make them feel 
considered. This process is already very stressful. I want to make it lighter for them with 
flexible sections and an interesting structure. Also, choosing from the different templates fits 
the application aspiration and is a part of its mentioned grand plan. Also, choosing from the

Additionally, the latex option is the manifestation of maximum freedom that the user can 
reach. We are offering that option too.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The application looks the way as other applications that include forms. However, it has 
more functionality. For instance, it offers to add multiple similar form elements (sections).
The main page is the view that any user can adapt smoothly. It only has a few 
authorization buttons and the guest mode button. If a user continues as a guest, they can still 
access the main functionality. They can build a resume with a default template. Meanwhile, 
authorized users can save the resumes and update them later. They can create as many resumes 
as they want. Additionally, authorized ones can create a new template with the specifically 
picked template they chose.
